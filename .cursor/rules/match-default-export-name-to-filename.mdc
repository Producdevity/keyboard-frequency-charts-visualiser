- When a file contains a single default export, the exported variable or function should match the file name (in PascalCase or camelCase as appropriate).
- Promotes clarity and consistency across the codebase.
- ❗ **Exception**: Files that are part of Next.js's file-based routing system (e.g. `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx`) are excluded from this rule.

❌ Bad
```tsx
// file: layout.ts
const planckLayout = { ... }
export default planckLayout
```

✅ Good:
```tsx
// file: planckLayout.ts
const planckLayout = { ... }
export default planckLayout
```

✅ Good:
```tsx
// file: layouts/index.ts
export {
  planckLayout,
  preonicLayout
} 
```
