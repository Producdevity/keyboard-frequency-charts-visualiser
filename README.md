## About this Project

This is an app to visualise your keyboard input frequency. This could be used to optimise your custom keyboard layout.

I've been keylogging my key inputs for a while now using [this keylogger program](https://github.com/GiacomoLaw/Keylogger) made by [GiacomoLaw](https://github.com/GiacomoLaw).

This is very much still a "work in progress" but feel free to play around with it.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
